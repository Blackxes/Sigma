After cloning the repository via your preferred method execute the `scripts/GenerateProjectfiles.bat` batch file

It changes the directory to the solutions root directory and starts the project file building process with premake

Its executable for easier access for now lies in `vendor/premake/premake5`
[Download](https://premake.github.io/download/) it yourself and replace the one inside that directory if you don't trust it
